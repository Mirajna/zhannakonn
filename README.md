# Bicycle template

```This webpack works correctly with Node.js "14.18.1 LTS"
```

```powershell
To start build:

npm ci (to start project)

npm run watch   (for start watching the project)
npm run build   (for build project once with minification of .js and .css files)
```

```For Http-server:

npm i -g http-server   (for global "npm install http-server -g")
http-server dist/
```

```If http-server cannot be loaded in Windows 10, to fix it you should run PowerShell as administrator and execute command: 
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted   (for security, feasibly to return the value of this item back to "Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted" after work)
```
